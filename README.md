# TheLostRealm

Collaborated as a team of 3 people working on creating a 2D tilemap Unity game, with the main focus of the project being a procedurally generated map at runtime. The game "The Lost Realm" is a simple fantasy game with inspiration from both Zelda and Age of Empires. At runtime, a random map is generated, where a player then has to battle their way through enemy soldiers in order to reach the safety of the castle. 

More details are outlined in the attached report.pdf.
